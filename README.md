This project was created for the [Tic Tac Toe assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives, including adding the optional AI component. The AI was created using the [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), which calculates and scores potential future moves and chooses the best move based on those scores.

### Provided Assets

* None

### Objectives

1. Store game board in array within an object
2. Store players in objects
3. Create object for game flow
4. Minimize global scope code
5. Function to render contents of game board
6. Build logic to determine winner/tie
7. Display elements for finished games
8. (+1) Create AI that chooses random moves
9. (+1) Create intelligent AI with Minimax Algorithm

### Scope Creep

* Lifetime Win/Loss/Tie scores via `LocalStorage`
* Responsive Design
* PWA and A2HS support
